## Self Promotional Website
For Part 1 of the CS/COE 1520 project, I will be designing and implementing a self promotional website, which will contain my resume, information about projects that I have worked on, and personal interests.  The site will also have links to my contact information, particularly so that site visitors can contact me on LinkedIn.
