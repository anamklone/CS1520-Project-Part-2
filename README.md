# Project Part 2 Proposal
> Anastasia Klonowski<br>CS/COE 1520<br>[amk226@pitt.edu](mailto:amk226@pitt.edu)

For Part 2 of the CS/COE 1520 project, I will be improving upon the self-promotional website I created in Part 1.  I hope to make my website more responsive and add a page to display the projects I have completed and am currently working on.  I'm also planning on taking some time to update my resume and add some more information about my relevant coursework.

To showcase my proficiency with PHP and databases, I am thinking about adding the ability for a user to login and maybe access some kind of profile page where they can change account settings.  I am quite interested in learning what all will need to be done to achieve this.

#### Technology I Will Be Using
* PHP
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap
* jQuery
* AJAX
